# :desert_island::volcano: Capy-Island
You and 3 friends will compete on an island in 4-6 minigames to decide who is the winner. Collect basic and special hats to give yourself a step up in the final round, and be selected as the winner. A great game for a chill night with friends!

*This game is created for 2022-2023 Interactive Multimedia and Design's Capstone project*
